#  MetaBase 6.0 Initial Sketch

- Skeleton screens without functionality
- Sketches wrapping Combine SDK for easy testing and mocking

Tip: Use the Workspace so new files in SPM packages use the right copyright.

Tip: To use SwiftUI previews for screens in the `Features` package, switch the Xcode scheme to that target. You'll get a Previews build error if the current scheme is something else (e.g., the app).

### To Do List
- [ ] Add mock screens (device management, recording setup/stop, session export)
- [ ] Add mock clients (scanner, device)
- [ ] Add mock onboarding/upgrade flow
